Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of data types and data structures in programming. These are categorized into primitive types, composite types, and abstract data structures across various languages:

1. Data Types
Primitive Data Types
These are the basic building blocks of data in programming.

Category	            Data Types	                                                            Examples
Numeric	                - Integer (int)	                                                        5, -42
                        - Floating-point (float, double)	                                    3.14, -0.001
                        - Fixed-point, Decimal	12.45 (used in financial applications)
                        - Complex Numbers (complex)	3+4j (in Python)
Character	            - Character (char)	                                                    'a', '@'
Boolean	                - Boolean (bool)	                                                    True, False
Null/None	            - Null type (null, None)	                                            Indicates "no value"
Enumerations	        - Enum	enum Days                                                       {Mon, Tue, Wed}



Composite Data Types
These combine multiple values into a single unit.   

Category	        Data Types	                                Examples
Text	            - String (str)	                            "hello", 'world'
Array	            - Array	                                    [1, 2, 3]
Tuple	            - Tuple	                                    (1, "hello", 3.14)
Dictionary	        - Map (dict, hashmap, associative array)	{"key": "value"}
Set	                - Set	                                    {1, 2, 3}




2. Data Structures
Linear Data Structures
Data is organized in a sequential manner.

Type	Description	Examples
Array	Collection of elements of the same type.	[10, 20, 30]
Linked List	Nodes linked via pointers.	head -> node1 -> node2
Stack	LIFO (Last In, First Out).	push, pop
Queue	FIFO (First In, First Out).	enqueue, dequeue
Deque	Double-ended queue.	append, pop
Non-Linear Data Structures
Data is organized hierarchically or in networks.

Type	Description	Examples
Trees	Hierarchical structure.	Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL, Heap, B+ Tree
Graphs	Nodes connected by edges.	Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Cyclic
Hash-Based Structures
Efficient storage and retrieval.

Type	Description	Examples
Hash Table	Key-value pairs with fast lookups.	Python's dict, Java's HashMap
Hash Set	Unique elements with fast lookups.	{1, 2, 3}
Advanced Structures
Specialized for specific use cases.

Type	Description	Examples
Trie	Prefix-based tree for strings.	Auto-complete, Dictionary lookups
Segment Tree	Efficient range queries.	Sum, Min, Max of ranges in an array
Fenwick Tree	Efficient prefix sums.	Binary Indexed Tree
Disjoint Set	For union-find operations.	Connected components in a graph
Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
These define operations, not implementation.

ADT	Description	Examples
List	Sequential collection.	append, insert
Map/Dictionary	Key-value collection.	put, get
Priority Queue	Elements prioritized based on value.	Min-Heap, Max-Heap
Graph ADT	Representation of nodes and edges.	Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix
